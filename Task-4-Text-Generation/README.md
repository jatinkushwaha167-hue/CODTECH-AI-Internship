# Task 4: Text Generation using LSTM

This task implements a text generation model using LSTM
(Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

## Description
The model is trained on a text corpus and learns word
sequences to generate new coherent text.

## Files
- text_generation_lstm.py : Python implementation of LSTM model
- input.txt : Training text data

## Output
After training, the model generates new text based on a
given seed input.
